# Bits of Code

Welcome to my collection of handy Python scripts! Below, you'll find my creations designed to simplify some interesting tasks and showcase my programming skills. Each script has its own purpose and flair. Explore the code and feel free to dive into the logic behind them.

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Scripts

### `CF.py` - **Closest Factorial**
Path: `py/CF.py`  
This script takes a number and finds the closest factorial to it. Whether you're working with factorials for mathematical fun or solving problems, this one gets you to the answer quickly!

**Key Features:**
- Efficiently finds the closest factorial.
- Handles both larger and smaller numbers seamlessly.
- Ideal for mathematical problem-solving and quick analysis.

### `RF.py` - **Reverse Factorial**
Path: `py/RF.py`  
This script works in reverse! Given a number, it returns the integer whose factorial is used to make that number. If you're trying to reverse-engineer factorials, this one's for you.

**Key Features:**
- Reverses the factorial operation.
- Works with large numbers to find the original integer.
- Perfect for mathematical curiosity or puzzle-solving.

### `Color Encoder.py` - **Encode Text To Color**
Path: `py/Color Encoder.py`  
This script will turn any ASCII text into an RGB/HEX value.

**Key Features:**
- Handles errors well. Wrong input? It shouldn't break or stop.
- Encode/Double Encode text. Encode will make it RGB, and Double Encode will make it HEX!
- Decode/Double Decode values. Decode turns any RGB value into text, while Double Decode turns any HEX value into text!

## ðŸ”§ Usage

Simply clone the repository and run the desired Python script in your terminal or development environment. Both of these scripts are straightforward to use, and the logic is clean and easy to follow. Check out the functions and explore the possibilities.
